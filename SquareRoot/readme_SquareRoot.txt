*Description-
The given program implements the square root of a number which handles the invalid inputs using exception handling.

*Test Strategies-
-Tests are written with considering the possible inputs
from the user so that the program should run successfully 
in all possible user inputs.
-The user input is checked for the zero value and negative values
so that program will give correct output.

*Test Cases-
1.When user inputs the positive value then it will return a square root of that number.
e.g.
 If user inputs: number = 64 ,then output: square root= 8 

2.When user inputs the neagtive value i.e. the value less zero, then it will throw exception with custom exception message
e.g.
 If user inputs: number = -24.28, then output: Invalid input : can't find the square root of negative number
