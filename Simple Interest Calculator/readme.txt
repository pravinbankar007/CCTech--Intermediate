*Description-
The given program implements a simple interest calculator by using oject oriented programming approach.

*Test Strategies-
-Tests are written with considering the possible inputs
from the user so that the program should run successfully 
in all possible user inputs.
-The user input is checked for the zero and negative values
so that program will give correct output.

*Test Cases-
1.When user inputs the either the principal amount or rate or time value equal 
to zero then it will show output as invalid input.
e.g.
 If user inputs: principal_amount = 0 or rate = 0 or time = 0 ,
then it will show output as: Invalid input , Please enter valid input

2.When user inputs the either the principal amount or rate or time value is equal 
to zero then it will show output as invalid input.
e.g.
 If user inputs: principal_amount = -5423 or rate = -7.53 or time = -3 ,
then it will show output as: Invalid input , Please enter valid input
